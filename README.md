# ConnectivityAnalyzer
Determines whether the graph of an adjacency matrix is strongly connected.

The focus of the project is the understanding of graph theory and algorithm complexity analysis. In this project, we are required to implement an algorithm that can determine the connectivity of both directed and undirected graphs.
